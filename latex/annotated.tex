Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_data}{Data}} \\*This class is used to store all the contents from the .csv files into a graph. It will be used by the menu class to implement the different proposed algorithms }{\pageref{class_data}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_edge}{Edge$<$ T $>$}} \\*For this specific project, an edge represents the distance between two locations(vertexes) }{\pageref{class_edge}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_graph}{Graph$<$ T $>$}} \\*The main class, where the structure used for all the project resides }{\pageref{class_graph}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_menu}{Menu}} \\*Represents the user-\/friendly interface to Routing Algorithm for Ocean Shipping and Urban Deliveries. It shows available functionalities, their corresponding outputs and performance in a clear, organized, and logical manner, facilitating seamless program utilization and straightforward result interpretation }{\pageref{class_menu}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_mutable_priority_queue}{Mutable\+Priority\+Queue$<$ T $>$}} }{\pageref{class_mutable_priority_queue}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_vertex}{Vertex$<$ T $>$}} \\*For this specific project, a vertex\textquotesingle{}s info is just the identifier of each vertex, and each vertex represents a location }{\pageref{class_vertex}}{}
